\section{Working experiences}
\subsection{Vocational}
\cventry{March 2016--Today}{Free Software Consultant}{Savoir-Faire Linux}{Montréal}{}{Savoir-Faire Linux is a company of consultants specialized in \textit{Free-Software}. I am part of the Industrial Solution Team who is in charge of developing the \textit{Linux Embedded Systems} that are embedded in the devices of our customers.
\begin{itemize}
\item I implemented a framework in C++ 11 to exchange data between different devices. I used \textit{ZeroMQ} as the bus for communications and \textit{Protobuf} as the format for data exchange. I developed a system of plug-in based on \textit{ld}. The code is covered using \textit{gcov}.
\item I bumped the embedded software of an \textit{IoT} device to the latest version of \textit{Yocto}. I moved the init system to \textit{systemd}. I fixed low-level and system related issues.
\item I customized the interface written in \textit{LuCI} of a network device based on \textit{OpenWrt}. I compiled and setup the docker daemon to run \textit{Docker} images on that device.
\item I mainlined the package \textit{QtWebEngine}, the board \textit{Raspberry Pi 3 (64-bits)}, and fixed build issues in \textit{Buildroot}.
\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{July 2010--September 2015}{Embedded Linux Engineer}{Overkiz SAS, Somfy group}{Archamps}{}{Overkiz is specialized in \textit{Cloud Computing} for \textit{Home-Automation}. It develops a solution which connects objects from Home to \textit{Internet} (\textit{IoT}). It consists of a gateway that links home-automation devices to its servers. We can control objects from Home thanks to a smart-phone and Web-Services. I was part of the Embedded Team who develops Embedded Linux System of gateways.
\begin{itemize}
\item I was co-maintainer of our home-made Embedded Linux distribution. I did the integration of software from the Open-Source community.
\item I was also responsible for the deployment of the embedded software updates.
\item I set up the Yocto Build System that builds the embedded software. It builds from scratch the whole embedded software. Yocto allows to save hours to the embedded developers and minimizes errors when releases are built introduced by human operations.
\item I developed home-made frameworks and applications to support new home-automation protocols into our gateways. I was also in charge of developing the application that creates the connection between the box and the server. Frameworks and applications are both developed in C++.
\item I developed kernel modules and I did two boards bring-up and mainlined them inside into Linux kernel sources.
\item I also contributed to Open-Source projects (see Open-Source Contributions section).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Periods}
\cventry{2009}{Master Trainee}{LC Mobility}{Australia}{}{LC Mobility is specialized in receiving foreign Ph.D. students. I made a market search about the mobility of the Australian students in Australia.}
\cventry{2008}{3rd-year Engineer Trainee}{Freescale Semiconductors}{Toulouse}{}{I was responsible for the development of a battery-charging driver on Freescale smartphone platform (ARM-11 based). This mobile-phone is power-supplied by a Li-ion battery. It runs Nokia S60 (Symbian OS). I developed the driver in C++ using Symbian mechanisms.}
\cventry{2007}{2nd-year Engineer Trainee}{Sagem Monetel}{Valence}{}{I was in charge of memory optimization (dynamic and static) of a C application embedded in a banking terminal powered by two ARM processors. I used listing and map files generated by the free GNU/GCC compiler to locate heavy memory structures. I reduced the application size by more than 30\%.}
\cventry{2004}{Technical Trainee}{Sagem Monetel}{Valence}{}{I was in charge of changing the compiler of an embedded C application to the free GNU/GCC compiler. I also developed a benchmark to demonstrate the power of a payment terminal during a transaction.}
\subsection{Open-Source Contributions}
\cvitem{\href{https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot/commits?author=gazoo74}{Buildroot}}{I fixed build issues and added package QtWebEngine and config Raspberry Pi 3 (64-bits).}
\cvitem{\href{https://github.com/pengutronix/genimage/commits?author=gazoo74}{genimage}}{I added a hdimage property to set the position of the extended partition recorded into the Master Boot Record.}
\cvitem{\href{https://github.com/lighttpd/lighttpd1.4/commits?author=gazoo74}{Lighttpd}}{I mainlined CRLs for client certificate verification and make client verification errors ignored is not enforced. I fixed two build issues.}
\cvitem{\href{https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/commits?author=gazoo74}{jack2}}{I fixed uninitialized members that cause invalid reads when run by valgrind.}
\cvitem{\href{https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&q=PORTAY}{Linux Kernel}}{I added two Atmel SoC based device-trees.}
\cvitem{\href{https://github.com/linux4sam/at91bootstrap/commits?author=gazoo74}{Atmel at91bootstrap}}{I brought support for UBI. The goal is to improve critical upgrades against unexpected power-cuts. Critical volumes, such as kernels or bootloaders, are duplicated and stored in UBI static volumes. The bootstrap simply checks the volume integrity using update flag from UBI headers.}
\cvitem{\href{https://github.com/bagder/curl/commits?author=gazoo74}{CURL}}{I upgraded libcurl to that it is compatible with the latest PolarSSL Library API. I also fixed a bug with the polling mechanism that causes a timeout while processing SSL handshake with the distant server.}
\cvitem{\href{http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/opkg/log/?qt=grep&q=PORTAY}{OPKG}}{I improved CURL integration to allow libcurl related settings into the configuration file. I also fixed unexpected behaviors.}
\cvitem{\href{https://github.com/mkj/dropbear/commits?author=gazoo74}{Dropbear}}{I removed compilation warnings from the entire project.}
